    <h1>Fried eggs</h1>
    <img src="burgerImg.jpg" alt="Hamburger">
    <h4>A fried egg is a cooked dish made from one or more eggs which are removed from their shells and placed into a frying pan and fried. They are traditionally eaten for breakfast in many countries but may also be served at other times of the day.</h4>
       <p>Fried eggs (Spiegeleier; singular Spiegelei) are a crucial part of such traditional German dishes as Strammer Max (the egg is fried on one side with an unbroken yolk, and served "sunny side up" atop an open ham sandwich) or Hamburger 
        Schnitzel / Holsteiner Schnitzel / Fernfahrerschnitzel ("trucker's schnitzel") â€“ a similarly prepared fried egg served on a Wiener Schnitzel.</p>
